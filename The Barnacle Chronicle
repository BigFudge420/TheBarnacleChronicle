I got bored. Literally the only reason why I bothered. But yea this is basically a simple tribute page for the Barnacle, the legend-wait for it-dary brofessional Barnabus Stinson. I made it out of HTML and CSS. Might a dd more to it if I'm bored enough. And if anyone has any good ideas for the page just let me know on Discord.
